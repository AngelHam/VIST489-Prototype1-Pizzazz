Current Bugs / TODO fix:


	• The 2nd puzzle in area 2 visual rips like with cosmetic stuff around
	• The first puzzle in area 2 backgrounds nearby glitch a bit
	• theres this small dark hole in area 1 underneath the platform the one where it doesnt have a dude underneath
	• Playerball faces a weird direction when traveling along the paths
Floor panels the area 2 puzzles (especially last puzzle need to be redone so they are alligned and straight)


• (partially done) First person mode? camera slightly in front, triggered by zooming in all the way? could be nice --- ((changed min spring arm target length to be 0, at 0, we turn off the playermodel visuals..
	• Red particle attack is a lil buggy in this mode
• Elevator level sequencer pattern could just be too confusing, not a point to have it like that we could just simplify especially since its hard for new players to recognize the pattern + the jump in translation is shocking
• (partially done) Settings page option that has the ability to alter how fast the camera pans when you look around
	• No sync between Pause Menu and Main Menu.. They slightly update but visually they are not set
	• Similar important issue, onLoad of next map, the settings for Camera Sensitivity, since it is tied to a newly loaded PlayerBot, do not save and revert to default
• 2nd shop, none of the items I purchased were saved??? (Quick remedy is to not show the shop again after area2...)

• Demo end: The main robot guy's text glitches the fuck out after he talks??
GAME BREAKING BUG: Last puzzle is unsolvable? I put in first an incorrect solution, then a correct one, and the puzzle failed...
